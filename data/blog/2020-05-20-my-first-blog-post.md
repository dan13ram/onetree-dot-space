Hello guys, welcome to my blog!

```
 echo "# Hello world!"
```

# Hello world!

I'm writing my first blog post right now. I never thought that I would be using markdown to write my blog, but when I actually think about it there can be no better option. This is fantastic. I can write in vim and it gets directly uploaded onto my website in a nice format!

I can add images like this

```
![Bob Dylan Smoking](/img/charcoal/bob-dylan-smoking.jpeg)
```

and that results in the following:

I can add todo notes like so

```
- Make website
- Write Intro
- Add Content
```

and that results in the following:

-   Make website
-   Write Intro
-   Add Content

I can also make numbered nodes like so

```
1. This is first
2. This is in between
3. This should be last
```

and that results in the following:

1. This is first
2. This is in between
3. This should be last

Hope you learnt something about markdown. Until next time!

Ciao
